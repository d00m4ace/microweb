Code blocks must be indented by 4 whitespaces.
Python-Markdown has a auto-guess function which works
pretty well:

    print("Hello, World")
    # some comment
    for letter in "this is a test":
        print(letter)

In cases where Python-Markdown has problems figuring out which
programming language we use, we can also add the language-tag
explicitly. One way to do this would be:


    :::python
    print("Hello, World")

or we can highlight certain lines to
draw the reader's attention:

Highlighting specific linesÂ¶
Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1.

Example:


``` python hl_lines="3 4"
""" Bubble sort """
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```
